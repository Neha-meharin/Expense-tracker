### **Project Description**  
PocketHero is currently in its early stages of development. The platform aims to gamify financial management by introducing daily challenges, community interactions, and reward-based tracking. Users will earn points for completing financial goals, and once they surpass a set threshold, they can redeem them for vouchers and rewards.

Future updates will introduce interactive insights with charts, a more advanced finance tracker, and community-driven challenges to make personal finance both engaging and rewarding. 

## **The Problem Statement**  
Managing finances can be **boring and tedious** for hostelers. Most people don’t track their expenses properly, leading to overspending and poor budgeting.  

## **The Solution**  
PocketHero makes finance tracking **fun** with a gamified XP system. Users set budgets, add expenses, and even split costs among friends while earning XP and leveling up! 💰🎮
